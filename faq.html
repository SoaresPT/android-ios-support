<button class="accordion">Pokémon GO Three-Strike Discipline Policy</button>
<div class="panel">

<font color=red><h3>Keep in mind that offenders are not always offered three strikes. Some misbehaviors may result in immediate account termination without prior warning.</h3></font>

<font size=5><b>Strike 1: Warning</b></font>
<br>
<font size=4><b>Disciplinary actions:</b></font>

<p>If this strike is issued, you will see a warning message within the Pokémon GO app informing you that we have detected cheating on your account.

In addition to this warning, your gameplay experience may be degraded in the following ways for the duration of the warning:<br>
<ul>
    <li>You may not be able to encounter rare Pokémon in the wild. These Pokémon may not appear on the map or on the Nearby Pokémon tracker.</li>
    <li>You may be excluded from receiving new EX Raid Passes.</li>
</ul>

<font size=4><b>Duration:</b></font>
<p>This strike will last for approximately 7 days. After this period, your gameplay experience will fully be restored.</p>
<br>

<font size=5><b>Strike 2: Suspension</b></font>
<br>
<font size=4><b>Disciplinary actions:</b></font>
<p>If your account is issued a second strike, you will temporarily lose access to your Pokémon GO account. When attempting to log into the game, you’ll be presented with a message stating that your account is suspended. You will not be able to bypass this message.</p>

<font size=4><b>Duration:</b></font>
<p>This strike will last for approximately 30 days. After that period, your account access will be restored.</p>
<br>

<font size=5><b>Strike 3: Termination</b></font>
<br>
<font size=4><b>Disciplinary actions:</b></font>
<p>If you receive the first and second strikes and continue to cheat, your account will be permanently banned.
</p>

<font size=4><b>Duration:</b></font>
<p>Permanent.</p>

   <button class="accordion">What is spoofing?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><b>Spoofing</b> is where you trick your device's GPS tracker to think it's in another location. Of course your whereabouts in Pokemon Go is completely dependent on this.</p>            
        </div>  

        <button class="accordion">How to Snipe?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>With the latest changes by Niantic, sniping is now much harder.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start by being idle (no pokestops, gyms, or catching Pokemon) for 2 hours. This includes having the app open or closed.</li>
                <li>Assume you are at location A and there is a Pokemon spawning at location B (which is more than 1000 km away). </li>
                <li>You can now teleport to B, encounter that Pokemon and capture it at B. Since Niantic records your encounter location now, your latest location is at B and not A anymore. </li>
                <li>Then, you can spin Pokestops at B without being soft banned. You may return to A or snipe at another distant location C after another 2 hours of idling.</p></li>

        <button class="accordion">What is a Softban?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Soft bans are temporary and may prevent you from interacting with the game. You may be temporarily soft banned if you find that you can't interact with elements in the game. For example, you may be soft banned if Pokestops spin but nothing happens and they remain blue, if you can't spin Pokestops at all, or if you throw a pokeball at a pokemon and it hits, but the pokemon flee or you got kicked from a gym battle.</p>
        </div>
        

        <button class="accordion">What is Shadowban?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A shadow ban, different than a soft ban, doesn't prevent you from playing. What it does is prevent you from seeing anything other than common spawns- Pidgey, Rattata, and the like. In other words, no rare Pokemons for you! No Eevee, no Growlithe, and certainly no Snorlax, Dragonite, or Tyranitar. You can still hatch eggs, spin stops and catch Pokemon you can see and does not affect Raids.</p>
        </div>
        

        <button class="accordion">How to earn Coins?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Players get one coin for every 10 minutes a Pokemon is in a gym, for a maximum of 50 coins a day. This means one Pokemon has to be in a gym for eight hours and 20 minutes to max out on coins. The daily reset for coins happens at 12 a.m. in your local time zone. You also only get your coins after the Pokemon is defeated and returns to you. However, you won't get coins for previous days. This means if your Pokemon was in the gym for two full days, you'll only get the daily max of 50 coins.</p>
        </div>
        

        <button class="accordion">What is the daily/ weekly catch limit?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes! There is a daily/ weekly catch limit in the game which is 1,000 Pokemon per day or 7,000 per week. This so-called "Catch Ban" doesn't affect Shadow Pokemon. Yes, you can actually catch 1,000 Pokemon per day using Gotcha/Go Plus and playing in a bigger city for 7-8 hours.</p>

        <div class="panel">

        <button class="accordion">What is Pokemon Camping?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If a Pokemon that you're very much desired has spawned but you're still in cooldown, you can teleport to the Pokemon's location, tap on the Pokemon to enter the capture screen, but DO NOT attempt to throw the Poke Balls or feed any berry. Off the screen to let Pokemon Go app running in the background. Make sure you don't use the smartphone too much as iOS and Android may force close the game to release resources. Wait until the cool down period has passed (e.g. driving time to reach the place or max 2 hours for far flung location, then attempt to catch the Pokemon.</p>
